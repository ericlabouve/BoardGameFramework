# BoardGameFramework
A framework I designed written in Java for implementing any board game. Includes 2 pluggins: Pawns and Hurkle. For each pluggin, there are 3 skins available. The framework is unit tested with code coverage at 95%.

Commandline arguments control which pluggin is lanched and flags are used to specify a gui or console interface:
"Pawns" for launching the Pawns pluggin
"Hurkle" for launching the Hurkle pluggin
-g for gui
-c for console
